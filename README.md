# Graphics-1-Data-Visualiser
This project is a data visualiser made with C++ and OpenGL as part of the Graphics 1 module during the 2nd year of my degree.

The visualiser imports data from CSV files (with the user specifying if the data delimiter is , or ;) and renders it into one of a variety of interactive graphs the user can choose from. The user is able to pan and zoom the graphs - or in the case of the 3D scatter plot, pan and rotate, and click on the individual elements of the graph to be shown the exact quantity the element represents (except in the 3D scatter plot).

Available graph types are:
 - Bar Chart
 - Line Chart
 - Pie Chart
 - 2D Scatter Plot
 - 3D Scatter Plot
 
The skeleton of an OpenGL program was provided as part of the assignment, with the importing and rendering of data into graphs left up to the students. The skeleton comprised of the visual studio project files and the following C++ source files: Listener, OGLApplication, OGLRectangle, OGLWin32, OGLWindow, Renderable, Resource, targetver and Vector2D. These files were modified with my own code. Any other C++ files in the project are entirely my own code.
